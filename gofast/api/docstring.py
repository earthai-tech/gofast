    one-vs-rest strategy over the binary classification problem.

    inherit from base.ClassifierMixin, which sets their _estimator_type attribute.
    A classifier can be distinguished from other estimators with is_classifier.

        * fit

    Possible inputs for cv are usually::

            K-fold will be stratified over classes if the estimator is a classifier
