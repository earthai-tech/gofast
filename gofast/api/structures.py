class Bunch:
    """
    A utility class for storing collections of results or data attributes.
    
    This class is designed to bundle various attributes and provide a 
    convenient way to access them using attribute-style access instead of 
    dictionary-style. It overrides the `__repr__` and `__str__`
    methods to offer informative and readable representations of its contents.
    
    Methods
    -------
    __repr__()
        Provides a basic representation of the object, indicating it contains 
        results.
    
    __str__()
        Returns a string representation of the object's contents in a nicely 
        formatted way, showing each attribute and its corresponding value.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from gofast.tools.box import Bunch 
    >>> results = Bunch()
    >>> results.accuracy = 0.95
    >>> results.loss = 0.05
    >>> print(results)
    accuracy   0.95
    loss       0.05
    
    >>> results
    <Bunch object containing results. Use print() to see contents>
    
    Note
    ----

    the syntax of dictionaries, enhancing code readability and convenience.

        supports lists, tuples, sets, NumPy arrays, pandas Series, and pandas DataFrames.
    
        For numeric iterables (lists, tuples, sets, NumPy arrays), it calculates and
        includes statistics such as minimum value, maximum value, mean, and length
        (or dimensions and dtype for NumPy arrays). For pandas Series and DataFrames,
        it also considers data type and, when applicable, provides a summary including
        minimum value, maximum value, mean, number of rows, number of columns, and dtypes.

        the output to exclude statistical summaries that are not applicable.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        attr : iterable
            The iterable attribute of the Bunch object to be formatted. This can be a
            list, tuple, set, NumPy ndarray, pandas Series, or pandas DataFrame.
    
        Returns
        -------
        str
            A string representation of the iterable attribute, formatted according to
            its type and contents. This includes a concise summary of statistical
            information for numeric data and relevant structural information for all

    The `FlexDict` class extends the built-in `dict` class, so it inherits all the
    methods and behaviors of a standard dictionary. In addition to the standard
    dictionary interface, `FlexDict` allows for the setting, deletion, and access
    of keys as if they were attributes, providing an intuitive and flexible
    interface for managing dictionary data.

    Examples
    --------
    Here is how you can use a `FlexDict`:

    >>> from gofast.api.structures import FlexDict
    >>> fd = FlexDict(pkg='gofast', goal='simplify tasks', version='1.0')
    >>> fd['pkg']  # Standard dictionary access
    'gofast'
    >>> fd.pkg     # Attribute access
    'gofast'
    >>> fd.goal    # Another example of attribute access
    'simplify tasks'
    >>> fd.version # Accessing another attribute
    '1.0'
    >>> fd.new_attribute = 'New Value'  # Setting a new attribute
    >>> fd['new_attribute']             # The new attribute is accessible as a key
    'New Value'

    Notes
    -----
    - While `FlexDict` adds convenience, it is important to avoid key names that
      clash with the methods and attributes of a regular dictionary. Such conflicts
      can result in unexpected behavior, as method names would take precedence over
      key names during attribute access.

    - The behavior of `FlexDict` under serialization (e.g., when using pickle) may
      differ from that of a standard dictionary due to the attribute-style access.
      Users should ensure that serialization and deserialization processes are
      compatible with `FlexDict`'s approach to attribute access.

    - Since `FlexDict` is built on the Python dictionary, it maintains the same
      performance characteristics for key access and management. However, users
      should be mindful of the additional overhead introduced by supporting
      attribute access when considering performance-critical applications.

    By providing a dictionary that can be accessed and manipulated as if it were a
    regular object, `FlexDict` offers an enhanced level of usability, particularly
    in situations where the more verbose dictionary syntax might be less desirable.
