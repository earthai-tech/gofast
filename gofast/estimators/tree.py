    """
    Decision Tree-based Regressor for Regression Tasks.

    The `DTBRegressor` employs an ensemble approach, combining multiple 
    Decision Regression Trees to form a more robust regression model. Each 
    tree in the ensemble independently predicts the outcome, and the final 
    prediction is derived by averaging these individual predictions. This 
    method is effective in reducing variance and improving prediction accuracy 
    over a single decision tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the ensemble.
        
    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of each regression tree. If `None`, then nodes are 
        expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        `min_samples_split` samples.
        
    criterion : {"squared_error", "friedman_mse", "absolute_error", "poisson"},\
        default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria 
        are "squared_error" for mean squared error, "friedman_mse" for 
        mean squared error with improvement score by Friedman, "absolute_error" 
        for mean absolute error, and "poisson" for Poisson deviance.
        
    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported 
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to 
        choose the best random split.
        
    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and 
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum number of 
          samples for each split.
          
    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and 
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum number of 
          samples for each node.
          
    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all 
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node.
        
    max_features : int, float, str or None, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and 
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each 
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
        
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always 
        randomly permuted at each split. When `max_features` < n_features, 
        the algorithm will select `max_features` at random at each split 
        before finding the best split among them. Pass an int for reproducible 
        output across multiple function calls.
        
    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, default=None
        Grow a tree with `max_leaf_nodes` in best-first fashion. Best nodes 
        are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None, then unlimited 
        number of leaf nodes.
        
    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity 
        greater than or equal to this value.
    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The 
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than 
        `ccp_alpha` will be chosen.
        
    subsample : float, default=1.0
        The fraction of samples to be used for fitting each base learner.
        
    bootstrap : bool, default=True
        Whether samples are drawn with replacement. If False, sampling 
        without replacement is performed.
        
    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeRegressor
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.
    oob_score_ : float
        Out-of-bag score for the training dataset.

    Examples
    --------
    Here's an example of how to use the `DTBRegressor` on a dataset:

    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    >>> from gofast.estimators.tree import DTBRegressor

    >>> X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=4, noise=0.1)
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
    ...                                                     test_size=0.3, 
    ...                                                     random_state=0)
    
    >>> reg = DTBRegressor(n_estimators=50, max_depth=3, verbose=1)
    >>> reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
    >>> y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)

    Notes
    -----
    This model effectively combines the predictive power of multiple trees 
    through averaging, reducing variance and improving accuracy over a 
    single decision tree. The ensemble prediction is computed by averaging 
    the predictions from each individual Regression Tree within the ensemble, 
    as follows:

    .. math::
        y_{\text{pred}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{\text{tree}_i}

    where:
    - :math:`N` is the number of trees in the ensemble.
    - :math:`y_{\text{pred}}` is the final predicted value aggregated from 
      all trees.
    - :math:`y_{\text{tree}_i}` represents the prediction made by the 
      :math:`i`-th Regression Tree.

    The use of bootstrap sampling and subsampling enhances model robustness 
    and provides an estimate of model performance through out-of-bag (OOB) 
    score when subsampling is enabled.

        greater than or equal to this value.
        
    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The

        will be chosen.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        A list containing the fitted decision tree classifiers.

    Notes
    -----
    The final classification decision is made by aggregating the predictions 
    from all the decision trees and selecting the class with the majority vote:

    .. math::
        C_{\text{final}}(x) = \text{argmax}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta(C_i(x), \text{mode})\right)

    where:
    - :math:`C_{\text{final}}(x)` is the final predicted class label for input \(x\).
    - :math:`\delta(C_i(x), \text{mode})` is an indicator function that counts the 
      occurrence of the most frequent class label predicted by the \(i\)-th tree.
    - :math:`n` is the number of decision trees in the ensemble.
    - :math:`C_i(x)` is the class label predicted by the \(i\)-th decision tree.

    This ensemble approach significantly reduces the likelihood of overfitting and 
    increases the predictive performance by leveraging the diverse predictive 
    capabilities of multiple models.

    Example
    -------
    Here's an example of how to use the `DTBClassifier`:

    >>> from gofast.estimators.tree import DTBClassifier
    >>> rtec = DTBClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3,
    ...                                     random_state=42)
    >>> X, y = np.random.rand(100, 4), np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
    >>> rtec.fit(X, y)
    >>> y_pred = rtec.predict(X)

    Applications
    ------------
    The Decision Tree-Based Classifier is suitable for various classification
    tasks, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis.

    Performance
    -----------
    The model's performance depends on the quality of the data, the number of
    estimators (trees), and the depth of each tree. Hyperparameter tuning may
    be necessary to optimize performance.

    """
    Weighted Tree Classifier.

    The `WeightedTreeClassifier` is an ensemble learning model that 
    combines multiple decision trees using gradient boosting techniques 
    to tackle binary classification tasks. By integrating multiple 
    decision trees with varying weights, this classifier achieves high 
    accuracy and reduces the risk of overfitting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=50
        The number of decision trees in the ensemble. Increasing the number
        of estimators generally improves the performance but also increases
        the training time.

    eta0 : float, default=0.1
        The learning rate for gradient boosting, controlling how much each
        tree influences the overall prediction. Smaller values require more
        trees to achieve the same performance.

    max_depth : int, default=3
        The maximum depth of each decision tree, determining the complexity
        of the model. Deeper trees can model more complex patterns but may
        also lead to overfitting.

    criterion : {"gini", "entropy"}, default="gini"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria 
        are "gini" for the Gini impurity and "entropy" for the information 
        gain.

    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported 
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to 
        choose the best random split.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and 
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum number of 
          samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and 
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum number of 
          samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all 
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have 
        equal weight when `sample_weight` is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, str or None, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and 
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each 
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always 
        randomly permuted at each split. When `max_features` < n_features, 
        the algorithm will select `max_features` at random at each split 
        before finding the best split among them. 
        - Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, default=None
        Grow a tree with `max_leaf_nodes` in best-first fashion. Best nodes 
        are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None, then 
        unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity 
        greater than or equal to this value.

    class_weight : dict, list of dicts, "balanced" or None, default=None
        Weights associated with classes in the form `{class_label: weight}`. 
        If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. If "balanced", 
        the class weights will be adjusted inversely proportional to class 
        frequencies in the input data as `n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))`.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The 
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than 
        `ccp_alpha` will be chosen.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Controls the verbosity of the fitting process. If True, the progress
        of the fitting process is displayed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        List of base learners, each a decision tree.

    weights_ : list
        Weights associated with each base learner, influencing their
        contribution to the final prediction.

    Notes
    -----
    - The performance of the ensemble model depends on the quality of the base
      estimators and the hyperparameters.
    - Proper tuning of the hyperparameters is essential for achieving good
      performance.

    The weighted tree ensemble model follows a boosting approach where each
    subsequent tree is trained to correct the errors of the previous trees.
    The model can be mathematically formulated as follows:

    **Initialization**:
    .. math::
        F_0(x) = 0

    **Iteration for each tree**:
    1. Compute the weighted error:
       .. math::
           \epsilon_m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot I(y_i \neq h_m(x_i))}
                        {\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}

    2. Compute the weight of the tree:
       .. math::
           \alpha_m = \eta_0 \cdot \log\left(\frac{1 - \epsilon_m}{\epsilon_m}\right)

    3. Update the sample weights:
       .. math::
           w_i = w_i \cdot \exp(\alpha_m \cdot I(y_i \neq h_m(x_i)))

    where:
    - :math:`F_m(x)` is the prediction after `m` trees.
    - :math:`\eta_0` is the learning rate.
    - :math:`h_m(x)` is the prediction of the `m`-th tree.
    - :math:`\epsilon_m` is the weighted error.
    - :math:`\alpha_m` is the weight of the `m`-th tree.
    - :math:`w_i` is the weight of sample `i`.

        This method trains the ensemble of decision trees on the provided 
        training data `X` and target values `y`. For classification tasks, it 
        adjusts the weights of the samples to focus on the ones that are

        ----------
        X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training vectors, where `n_samples` is the number of samples and

        sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
            Individual weights for each sample. If None, all samples are given 
            equal weight. This parameter is used only for regression tasks.
    
        check_input : bool, default=True
            Allow to bypass several input checking.

        Returns

        self : object

        Notes 
        -------
        The fitting process involves different steps for classification and 
        regression tasks:
    
        **For Classification:**
        1. **Initialization of sample weights**:
           .. math::
               w_i = \frac{1}{n}, \quad \forall i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}
           where `n` is the number of samples.
    
        2. **Iteration for each tree**:
           a. Train a decision tree on the weighted dataset.
           b. Predict the labels and calculate the weighted error:
              .. math::
                  \text{Weighted Error} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \cdot (y_i \neq y_{\text{pred}_i}))
           c. Compute the weight for the current tree:
              .. math::
                  \alpha = \eta_0 \cdot \log\left(\frac{1 - \text{Weighted Error}}{\text{Weighted Error}}\right)
           d. Update the sample weights for the next iteration:
              .. math::
                  w_i = w_i \cdot \exp(\alpha \cdot (y_i \neq y_{\text{pred}_i}))
    
        - This method must be called before `predict` or `predict_proba`.
        - For classification, the sample weights are adjusted at each iteration 
          to focus on the samples that are misclassified.
        - For regression, the residuals are updated at each iteration to 
          minimize the prediction error.

class WeightedTreeRegressor(BaseWeightedTree, RegressorMixin):
    """
    Weighted Tree Regressor.

    The `WeightedTreeRegressor` is an ensemble learning model that combines
    multiple decision trees using gradient boosting techniques to tackle
    regression tasks. By integrating multiple decision trees with varying
    weights, this regressor achieves high accuracy and reduces the risk of
    overfitting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=50
        The number of decision trees in the ensemble. Increasing the number
        of estimators generally improves the performance but also increases
        the training time.

    eta0 : float, default=0.1
        The learning rate for gradient boosting, controlling how much each
        tree influences the overall prediction. Smaller values require more
        trees to achieve the same performance.

    max_depth : int, default=3
        The maximum depth of each decision tree, determining the complexity
        of the model. Deeper trees can model more complex patterns but may
        also lead to overfitting.

    criterion : {"squared_error", "friedman_mse", "absolute_error", "poisson"},\
        default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are:
        - "squared_error": Mean squared error, which is equal to variance 
          reduction as feature selection criterion.
        - "friedman_mse": Mean squared error with improvement score by Friedman.
        - "absolute_error": Mean absolute error.
        - "poisson": Poisson deviance as feature selection criterion.

    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to
        choose the best random split.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and 
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum number of 
          samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and 
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum number of 
          samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all 
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have 
        equal weight when `sample_weight` is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, str or None, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and 
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each 
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always 
        randomly permuted at each split. When `max_features` < n_features, 
        the algorithm will select `max_features` at random at each split 
        before finding the best split among them. 
        - Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, default=None
        Grow a tree with `max_leaf_nodes` in best-first fashion. Best nodes 
        are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None, then 
        unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity 
        greater than or equal to this value.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Controls the verbosity of the fitting process. If True, the progress
        of the fitting process is displayed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeRegressor
        List of base learners, each a decision tree.

    weights_ : list
        Weights associated with each base learner, influencing their
        contribution to the final prediction.

    Notes
    -----
    - The performance of the ensemble model depends on the quality of the base
      estimators and the hyperparameters.
    - Proper tuning of the hyperparameters is essential for achieving good
      performance.

    The weighted tree ensemble model follows a boosting approach where each
    subsequent tree is trained to correct the errors of the previous trees.
    The model can be mathematically formulated as follows:

    **Initialization**:
    .. math::
        F_0(x) = 0

    **Iteration for each tree**:
    .. math::
        r_i = y_i - F_{m-1}(x_i)

    .. math::
        F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \eta_0 \cdot f_m(x)

    where:
    - :math:`F_m(x)` is the prediction after `m` trees.
    - :math:`\eta_0` is the learning rate.
    - :math:`f_m(x)` is the prediction of the `m`-th tree.
    - :math:`r_i` is the residual for sample :math:`i`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from gofast.estimators.tree import WeightedTreeRegressor
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    >>> X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=20, random_state=42)
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
    >>> reg = WeightedTreeRegressor(n_estimators=10, eta0=0.1, max_depth=3)
    >>> reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
    >>> y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)
