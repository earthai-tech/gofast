class DependencyError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised for errors related to missing or incompatible 
    dependencies in the `gofast` package.

    This error is used to handle situations where essential dependencies 
    for a particular functionality are either not installed or incompatible 
    with the current environment. The message provided can include the 
    specific package or module causing the issue and potential solutions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> try:
    >>>     raise DependencyError("PyTorch is not installed. Please install "
    >>>                            "PyTorch by running 'pip install torch'.")
    >>> except DependencyError as e:
    >>>     print(e)
    PyTorch is not installed. Please install PyTorch by running 
    'pip install torch'.

    Notes
    -----
    - This exception can be raised when the `gofast` package detects that 
      a required dependency, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, is missing or 
      incompatible with the current system.
    - The error message should provide clear instructions to resolve the issue, 
      such as installation or upgrade commands.

    --------
    - `gofast.exceptions`: Other custom exceptions in the `gofast` package.
    - `gofast.utils.install_dependencies`: Function that installs missing 
      dependencies for the package.

class NotRunnedError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when an operation requiring a 'runned' state 
    is called on an object that has not completed the 'run' method.

    This exception is particularly relevant in `gofast` classes that 
    implement a 'run' method for initialization or execution before 
    further operations are performed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    message : str, optional
        A custom error message to be displayed. If not provided, a default
        message is used, informing the user that the required 'run' method 
        has not been executed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    message : str
        The error message provided during instantiation, or the default 
        message if none was provided.

    Notes
    -----
    This exception can be raised by utility functions like `check_is_runned`, 
    which validates whether a class object has been properly "runned" before 
    executing dependent operations. If an object lacks the `_is_runned` 
    attribute or the `__gofast_is_runned__` method, `NotRunnedError` is 
    triggered to ensure correct usage patterns.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from gofast.utils.validator import check_is_runned, NotRunnedError
    >>> class ExampleClass:
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self._is_runned = False
    ...
    ...     def run(self):
    ...         self._is_runned = True
    ...         print("Run completed.")
    ...
    ...     def process_data(self):
    ...         if not self._is_runned:
    ...             raise NotRunnedError("Object has not been runned.")
    ...         print("Processing data...")
    >>> model = ExampleClass()
    >>> try:
    ...     model.process_data()
    ... except NotRunnedError as e:
    ...     print(e)
    Object has not been runned.
