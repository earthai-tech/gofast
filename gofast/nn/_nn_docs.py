    - ``'elu'``: Exponential Linear Unit (ELU), a variant of ReLU that
      improves training performance by preventing dying neurons. ELU provides
      a smooth output for negative values, which can help mitigate the issue

          \end{cases}
      
      where \(\alpha\) is a constant (usually 1.0).

    - ``'relu'``: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), a widely used activation
      function that outputs zero for negative input and the input itself for
      positive values. It is computationally efficient and reduces the risk
      of vanishing gradients. The mathematical formulation for ReLU is:
      
      .. math:: 
          f(x) = \max(0, x)
      
      where \(x\) is the input value.

Parameters
----------
static_input_dim : int
    The dimensionality of each static input feature. This is the number 
    of features that do not change over time (e.g., static data such as 
    geographical coordinates, user demographics, etc.). For example, 
    if there are 2 static features (e.g., country, region), set this to 2.

dynamic_input_dim : int
    The dimensionality of each dynamic input feature. These are the 
    time-varying features (e.g., stock prices, temperature, etc.) that 
    change over time. This should be the number of features in your 
    temporal input data at each time step.

num_static_vars : int
    The number of static variables included in the input data. Static 
    variables are the features that do not change over time. For example, 
    this could be the number of static features such as geographical 
    attributes, demographic data, etc.

num_dynamic_vars : int
    The number of dynamic variables in the input data. These variables 
    change over time and are used to capture temporal patterns. For 
    example, the number of dynamic variables could be the number of 
    features such as stock prices, temperature, etc., that change across 
    different time steps.

hidden_units : int
    The number of hidden units in the layers of the model. This determines 
    the size of the hidden layers in the model architecture. A larger 
    number of hidden units allows the model to capture more complex 
    relationships in the data but may also increase computational cost.

num_heads: int
    The number of attention heads used in the multi-head attention 
    mechanism. This controls how many separate "attention" operations 
    are run in parallel. More heads typically allow the model to capture 
    more complex interactions within the input data.

dropout_rate : float
    The dropout rate used during training to prevent overfitting. This 
    value controls the fraction of input units to drop during training 
    (i.e., setting it to 0.2 means 20% of input units are randomly 
    set to zero in each forward pass). The value should be between 0 and 1.

forecast_horizon: int
    The number of time steps ahead to predict. This defines how far into 
    the future the model will generate predictions. For example, if set 
    to 7, the model will predict 7 future time steps from the current 
    data point. The value must be a positive integer (e.g., 1, 7, etc.).

quantiles: list, optional
    A list of quantiles for prediction. These quantiles define the 
    uncertainty in the predictions. For example, if set to `[0.1, 0.5, 0.9]`, 
    the model will output predictions for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles 
    of the forecasted distribution. If set to `None`, the model will output 
    only the mean prediction.

activation : {'elu', 'relu', 'tanh', 'sigmoid', 'linear', 'gelu'}
    The activation function used in the model. Common choices include:
    - `'relu'`: Rectified Linear Unit (recommended for deep models)
    - `'elu'`: Exponential Linear Unit
    - `'tanh'`: Hyperbolic Tangent
    - `'sigmoid'`: Sigmoid function (common for binary classification)
    - `'linear'`: Linear activation (used in regression problems)
    - `'gelu'`: Gaussian Error Linear Unit (often used in transformers)

use_batch_norm : bool, default True
    Whether to use batch normalization in the model. Batch normalization 
    helps improve training by normalizing the output of previous layers 
    and speeding up convergence. Set this to `True` to enable batch 
    normalization, or `False` to disable it.

num_lstm_layers : int
    The number of LSTM layers in the model. LSTMs are used to capture 
    long-term dependencies in the data. More LSTM layers allow the model 
    to capture more complex temporal patterns but may increase the 
    computational cost.

lstm_units : list of int, optional
    The number of units in each LSTM layer. This can be a list of integers 
    where each element corresponds to the number of units in a specific 
    LSTM layer. For example, `[64, 32]` means the model has two LSTM 
    layers with 64 and 32 units, respectively. If set to `None`, the 
    number of units will be inferred from the `hidden_units` parameter.

Notes
-----
The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model combines the strengths of
sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms to handle complex
temporal dynamics. It provides interpretability by allowing examination
of variable importance and temporal attention weights.

**Variable Selection Networks (VSNs):**

VSNs select relevant variables by applying Gated Residual Networks (GRNs)
to each variable and computing variable importance weights via a softmax
function. This allows the model to focus on the most informative features.

**Gated Residual Networks (GRNs):**

GRNs allow the model to capture complex nonlinear relationships while
controlling information flow via gating mechanisms. They consist of a
nonlinear layer followed by gating and residual connections.

**Static Enrichment Layer:**

Enriches temporal features with static context, enabling the model to
adjust temporal dynamics based on static information. This layer combines
static embeddings with temporal representations.

**Temporal Attention Layer:**

Applies multi-head attention over the temporal dimension to focus on
important time steps. This mechanism allows the model to weigh different
time steps differently when making predictions.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Let:

- :math:`\mathbf{x}_{\text{static}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_s \times d_s}` be the
  static inputs,
- :math:`\mathbf{x}_{\text{dynamic}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times n_d \times d_d}`
  be the dynamic inputs,
- :math:`n_s` and :math:`n_d` are the numbers of static and dynamic variables,
- :math:`d_s` and :math:`d_d` are their respective input dimensions,
- :math:`T` is the number of time steps.

**Variable Selection Networks (VSNs):**

For static variables:

.. math::

    \mathbf{e}_{\text{static}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_s} \alpha_i \cdot
    \text{GRN}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{static}, i})

For dynamic variables:

.. math::

    \mathbf{E}_{\text{dynamic}} = \sum_{j=1}^{n_d} \beta_j \cdot
    \text{GRN}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{dynamic}, :, j})

where :math:`\alpha_i` and :math:`\beta_j` are variable importance weights
computed via softmax.

**LSTM Encoder:**

Processes dynamic embeddings to capture sequential dependencies:

.. math::

    \mathbf{H} = \text{LSTM}(\mathbf{E}_{\text{dynamic}})

**Static Enrichment Layer:**

Combines static context with temporal features:

.. math::

    \mathbf{H}_{\text{enriched}} = \text{StaticEnrichment}(
    \mathbf{e}_{\text{static}}, \mathbf{H})

**Temporal Attention Layer:**

Applies attention over time steps:

.. math::

    \mathbf{Z} = \text{TemporalAttention}(\mathbf{H}_{\text{enriched}})

**Position-wise Feedforward Layer:**

Refines the output:

.. math::

    \mathbf{F} = \text{GRN}(\mathbf{Z})

**Final Output:**

For point forecasting:

.. math::

    \hat{y} = \text{OutputLayer}(\mathbf{F}_{T})

For quantile forecasting (if quantiles are specified):

.. math::

    \hat{y}_q = \text{OutputLayer}_q(\mathbf{F}_{T}), \quad q \in \text{quantiles}

where :math:`\mathbf{F}_{T}` is the feature vector at the last time step.

Notes
-----
When using quantile regression by specifying the ``quantiles`` parameter,
ensure that your loss function is compatible with quantile prediction,
such as the quantile loss function. Additionally, the model output will
have multiple predictions per time step, corresponding to each quantile.

Parameters
----------
static_input_dim : int
    Dimensionality of static input features (no time dimension).  
    These features remain constant over time steps and provide
    global context or attributes related to the time series. For
    example, a store ID or geographic location. Increasing this
    dimension allows the model to utilize more contextual signals
    that do not vary with time. A larger `static_input_dim` can
    help the model specialize predictions for different entities
    or conditions and improve personalized forecasts.

dynamic_input_dim : int
    Dimensionality of dynamic input features. These features vary
    over time steps and typically include historical observations
    of the target variable, and any time-dependent covariates such
    as past sales, weather variables, or sensor readings. A higher
    `dynamic_input_dim` enables the model to incorporate more
    complex patterns from a richer set of temporal signals. These
    features help the model understand seasonality, trends, and
    evolving conditions over time.

future_covariate_dim : int
    Dimensionality of future known covariates. These are features
    known ahead of time for future predictions (e.g., holidays,
    promotions, scheduled events, or future weather forecasts).
    Increasing `future_covariate_dim` enhances the model’s ability
    to leverage external information about the future, improving
    the accuracy and stability of multi-horizon forecasts.

embed_dim : int, optional
    Dimension of feature embeddings. Default is ``32``. After
    variable transformations, inputs are projected into embeddings
    of size `embed_dim`. Larger embeddings can capture more nuanced
    relationships but may increase model complexity. A balanced
    choice prevents overfitting while ensuring the representation
    capacity is sufficient for complex patterns.

forecast_horizons : int, optional
    Number of future time steps to predict. Default is ``1``. This
    parameter specifies how many steps ahead the model provides
    forecasts. For instance, `forecast_horizon=3` means the model
    predicts values for three future periods simultaneously.
    Increasing this allows multi-step forecasting, but may
    complicate learning if too large.

quantiles : list of float or str, optional
    Quantiles to predict for probabilistic forecasting. For example,
    ``[0.1, 0.5, 0.9]`` indicates lower, median, and upper bounds.
    If set to ``'auto'``, defaults to ``[0.1, 0.5, 0.9]``. If
    `None`, the model makes deterministic predictions. Providing
    quantiles helps the model estimate prediction intervals and
    uncertainty, offering more informative and robust forecasts.

max_window_size : int, optional
    Maximum dynamic time window size. Default is ``10``. Defines
    the length of the dynamic windowing mechanism that selects
    relevant recent time steps for modeling. A larger `max_window_size`
    enables the model to consider more historical data at once,
    potentially capturing longer-term patterns, but may also
    increase computational cost.

memory_size : int, optional
    Size of the memory for memory-augmented attention. Default is
    ``100``. Introduces a fixed-size memory that the model can
    attend to, providing a global context or reference to distant
    past information. Larger `memory_size` can help the model
    recall patterns from further back in time, improving long-term
    forecasting stability.

num_heads : int, optional
    Number of attention heads. Default is ``4``. Multi-head
    attention allows the model to attend to different representation
    subspaces of the input sequence. Increasing `num_heads` can
    improve model performance by capturing various aspects of the
    data, but also raises the computational complexity and the
    number of parameters.

dropout_rate : float, optional
    Dropout rate for regularization. Default is ``0.1``. Controls
    the fraction of units dropped out randomly during training.
    Higher values can prevent overfitting but may slow convergence.
    A small to moderate `dropout_rate` (e.g. 0.1 to 0.3) is often
    a good starting point.

output_dim : int, optional
    Dimensionality of the output. Default is ``1``. Determines how
    many target variables are predicted at each forecast horizon.
    For univariate forecasting, `output_dim=1` is typical. For
    multi-variate forecasting, set a larger value to predict
    multiple targets simultaneously.

anomaly_config : dict, optional
        Configuration dictionary for anomaly detection. It may contain 
        the following keys:

        - ``'anomaly_scores'`` : array-like, optional
            Precomputed anomaly scores tensor of shape `(batch_size, forecast_horizons)`. 
            If not provided, anomaly loss will not be applied.

        - ``'anomaly_loss_weight'`` : float, optional
            Weight for the anomaly loss in the total loss computation. 
            Balances the contribution of anomaly detection against the 
            primary forecasting task. A higher value emphasizes identifying 
            and penalizing anomalies, potentially improving robustness to
            irregularities in the data, while a lower value prioritizes
            general forecasting performance.
            If not provided, anomaly loss will not be applied.

        **Behavior:**
        If `anomaly_config` is `None`, both `'anomaly_scores'` and 
        `'anomaly_loss_weight'` default to `None`, and anomaly loss is 
        disabled. This means the model will perform forecasting without 
        considering  any anomaly detection mechanisms.

        **Examples:**
        
        - **Without Anomaly Detection:**
            ```python
            model = XTFT(
                static_input_dim=10,
                dynamic_input_dim=45,
                future_covariate_dim=5,
                anomaly_config=None,
                ...
            )
            ```
        
        - **With Anomaly Detection:**
            ```python
            import tensorflow as tf

            # Define precomputed anomaly scores
            precomputed_anomaly_scores = tf.random.normal((batch_size, forecast_horizons))

            # Create anomaly_config dictionary
            anomaly_config = {{
                'anomaly_scores': precomputed_anomaly_scores,
                'anomaly_loss_weight': 1.0
            }}

            # Initialize the model with anomaly_config
            model = XTFT(
                static_input_dim=10,
                dynamic_input_dim=45,

                ...
            )
            ```

anomaly_loss_weight : float, optional
    Weight of the anomaly loss term. Default is ``1.0``. 

attention_units : int, optional
    Number of units in attention layers. Default is ``32``.
    Controls the dimensionality of internal representations in
    attention mechanisms. More `attention_units` can allow the
    model to represent more complex dependencies, but may also
    increase risk of overfitting and computation.

hidden_units : int, optional
    Number of units in hidden layers. Default is ``64``. Influences
    the capacity of various dense layers within the model, such as
    those processing static features or for residual connections.
    More units allow modeling more intricate functions, but can
    lead to overfitting if not regularized.

lstm_units : int or None, optional
    Number of units in LSTM layers. Default is ``64``. If `None`,
    LSTM layers may be disabled or replaced with another mechanism.
    Increasing `lstm_units` improves the model’s ability to capture
    temporal dependencies, but also raises computational cost and
    potential overfitting.

scales : list of int, str or None, optional
    Scales for multi-scale LSTM. If ``'auto'``, defaults are chosen
    internally. This parameter configures multiple LSTMs to operate
    at different temporal resolutions. For example, `[1, 7, 30]`
    might represent daily, weekly, and monthly scales. Multi-scale
    modeling can enhance the model’s understanding of hierarchical
    time structures and seasonalities.

multi_scale_agg : str or None, optional
    Aggregation method for multi-scale outputs. Options:
    ``'last'``, ``'average'``, ``'flatten'``, ``'auto'``. If `None`,
    no special aggregation is applied. This parameter determines
    how the multiple scales’ outputs are combined. For instance,
    `average` can produce a more stable representation by averaging
    across scales, while `flatten` preserves all scale information
    in a concatenated form.

activation : str or callable, optional
    Activation function. Default is ``'relu'``. Common choices
    include ``'tanh'``, ``'elu'``, or a custom callable. The choice
    of activation affects the model’s nonlinearity and can influence
    convergence speed and final accuracy. For complex datasets,
    experimenting with different activations may yield better
    results.

use_residuals : bool, optional
    Whether to use residual connections. Default is ``True``.
    Residuals help in stabilizing and speeding up training by
    allowing gradients to flow more easily through the model and
    mitigating vanishing gradients. They also enable deeper model
    architectures without significant performance degradation.

use_batch_norm : bool, optional
    Whether to use batch normalization. Default is ``False``.
    Batch normalization can accelerate training by normalizing
    layer inputs, reducing internal covariate shift. It often makes
    model training more stable and can improve convergence,
    especially in deeper architectures. However, it adds complexity
    and may not always be beneficial.

final_agg : str, optional
    Final aggregation of the time window. Options:
    ``'last'``, ``'average'``, ``'flatten'``. Default is ``'last'``.
    Determines how the time-windowed representations are reduced
    into a final vector before decoding into forecasts. For example,
    `last` takes the most recent time step's feature vector, while
    `average` merges information across the entire window. Choosing
    a suitable aggregation can influence forecast stability and
    sensitivity to recent or aggregate patterns.

**Key Enhancements:**

- **Enhanced Variable Embeddings**: 
  Employs learned normalization and multi-modal embeddings to
  flexibly integrate static, dynamic, and future covariates. 
  This allows the model to effectively handle heterogeneous 
  inputs and exploit relevant signals from different data 
  modalities.
  
  The model applies learned normalization and multi-modal embeddings
  to unify static, dynamic, and future covariates into a common
  representation space. Let :math:`\mathbf{x}_{static}`, 
  :math:`\mathbf{X}_{dynamic}`, and :math:`\mathbf{X}_{future}` 
  denote the static, dynamic, and future input tensors:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{x}_{norm} = \frac{\mathbf{x}_{static} - \mu}
     {\sigma + \epsilon}
     
  After normalization, static and dynamic features are embedded:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{E}_{dyn} = \text{MultiModalEmbedding}
     ([\mathbf{X}_{dynamic}, \mathbf{X}_{future}])
     
  and similarly, static embeddings 
  :math:`\mathbf{E}_{static}` are obtained. This enables flexible 
  integration of heterogeneous signals.

- **Multi-Scale LSTM Mechanisms**: 
  Adopts multiple LSTMs operating at various temporal resolutions
  as controlled by `scales`. By modeling patterns at multiple
  time scales (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), the model can 
  capture long-term trends, seasonalities, and short-term 
  fluctuations simultaneously.
  
  Multiple LSTMs process the input at different scales defined by 
  `scales`. For a set of scales 
  :math:`S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\}`, each scale selects 
  time steps at intervals of :math:`s_i`:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{H}_{lstm} = \text{Concat}(
     [\text{LSTM}_{s_i}(\mathbf{E}_{dyn}^{(s_i)})]_{i=1}^{k})
     
  where :math:`\mathbf{E}_{dyn}^{(s_i)}` represents 
  :math:`\mathbf{E}_{dyn}` sampled at stride :math:`s_i`. This 
  approach captures patterns at multiple temporal resolutions 
  (e.g., daily, weekly).


- **Enhanced Attention Mechanisms**: 
  Integrates hierarchical, cross, and memory-augmented attention. 
  Hierarchical attention highlights critical temporal regions,
  cross attention fuses information from diverse feature spaces,
  and memory-augmented attention references a learned memory to
  incorporate long-range dependencies beyond the immediate 
  input window.
  
  XTFT integrates hierarchical, cross, and memory-augmented attention
  layers to enrich temporal and contextual relationships.  
  Hierarchical attention:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{H}_{hier} = \text{HierarchicalAttention}
     ([\mathbf{X}_{dynamic}, \mathbf{X}_{future}])
  
  Cross attention:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{H}_{cross} = \text{CrossAttention}
     ([\mathbf{X}_{dynamic}, \mathbf{E}_{dyn}])
  
  Memory-augmented attention with memory :math:`\mathbf{M}`:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{H}_{mem} = \text{MemoryAugmentedAttention}(
     \mathbf{H}_{hier}, \mathbf{M})
     
  Together, these attentions enable the model to focus on 
  short-term critical points, fuse different feature spaces,
  and reference long-range contexts.
  

- **Dynamic Quantile Loss**: 
  Implements adaptive quantile loss to produce probabilistic
  forecasts. This enables the model to return predictive intervals
  and quantify uncertainty, offering more robust and informed 
  decision-making capabilities.
  
  For quantiles :math:`q \in \{q_1,\ldots,q_Q\}`, and errors 
  :math:`e = y_{true} - y_{pred}`, quantile loss is defined as:
  .. math::
     \mathcal{L}_{quantile}(q) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} 
     \max(q \cdot e_n, (q-1) \cdot e_n)
     
  This yields predictive intervals rather than single-point
  estimates, facilitating uncertainty-aware decision-making.
  
- **Multi-Horizon Output Strategies**:
  Facilitates forecasting over multiple future steps at once, 
  enabling practitioners to assess future scenarios and plan 
  accordingly. This functionality supports both deterministic 
  and probabilistic forecasts.
  
  XTFT predicts multiple horizons simultaneously. If 
  `forecast_horizons = H`, the decoder produces:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{Y}_{decoder} = \text{MultiDecoder}(\mathbf{H}_{combined})
     
  resulting in a forecast:
  .. math::
     \hat{\mathbf{Y}} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times H \times D_{out}}
  
  This allows practitioners to assess future scenarios over 
  multiple steps rather than a single forecast instant.

- **Optimization for Complex Time Series**:
  Utilizes multi-resolution attention fusion, dynamic time 
  windowing, and residual connections to handle complex and 
  noisy data distributions. Such mechanisms improve training 
  stability and convergence rates, even in challenging 
  environments.
  
  Multi-resolution attention fusion and dynamic time windowing 
  improve the model's capability to handle complex, noisy data:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{H}_{fused} = \text{MultiResolutionAttentionFusion}(
     \mathbf{H}_{combined})
  
  Along with residual connections:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{H}_{res} = \mathbf{H}_{fused} + \mathbf{H}_{combined}
  
  These mechanisms stabilize training, enhance convergence, and 
  improve performance on challenging datasets.

- **Advanced Output Mechanisms**:
  Employs quantile distribution modeling to generate richer
  uncertainty estimations, thereby enabling the model to
  provide more detailed and informative predictions than 
  single-point estimates.
  
  Quantile distribution modeling converts decoder outputs into a
  set of quantiles:
  .. math::
     \mathbf{Y}_{quantiles} = \text{QuantileDistributionModeling}(
     \mathbf{Y}_{decoder})
  
  enabling richer uncertainty estimation and more informative 
  predictions, such as lower and upper bounds for future values.

When `quantiles` are specified, XTFT delivers probabilistic 
forecasts that include lower and upper bounds, enabling better 
risk management and planning. Moreover, anomaly detection 
capabilities, governed by `anomaly_loss_weight`, allow the 
model to identify and adapt to irregularities or abrupt changes
in the data.

Key Functions
--------------
Consider a batch of time series data. Let:

- :math:`\mathbf{x}_{static} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times D_{static}}`
  represent the static (time-invariant) features, where
  :math:`B` is the batch size and :math:`D_{static}` is the
  dimensionality of static inputs.
  
- :math:`\mathbf{X}_{dynamic} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times D_{dynamic}}`
  represent the dynamic (time-varying) features over :math:`T` time steps.
  Here, :math:`D_{dynamic}` corresponds to the dimensionality of
  dynamic inputs (e.g., historical observations).

- :math:`\mathbf{X}_{future} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times D_{future}}`
  represent the future known covariates, also shaped by
  :math:`T` steps and :math:`D_{future}` features. These may
  include planned events or predicted conditions known ahead of time.

The model first embeds dynamic and future features via multi-modal
embeddings, producing a unified representation:
.. math::
   \mathbf{E}_{dyn} = \text{MultiModalEmbedding}\left(
   [\mathbf{X}_{dynamic}, \mathbf{X}_{future}]\right)

To capture temporal dependencies at various resolutions, multi-scale
LSTMs are applied. These can process data at different temporal scales:
.. math::
   \mathbf{H}_{lstm} = \text{MultiScaleLSTM}(\mathbf{E}_{dyn})

Multiple attention mechanisms enhance the model’s representational
capacity:

1. Hierarchical attention focuses on both short-term and long-term
   interactions between dynamic and future features:
   .. math::
      \mathbf{H}_{hier} = \text{HierarchicalAttention}\left(
      [\mathbf{X}_{dynamic}, \mathbf{X}_{future}]\right)

2. Cross attention integrates information from different modalities
   or embedding spaces, here linking original dynamic inputs and
   their embeddings:
   .. math::
      \mathbf{H}_{cross} = \text{CrossAttention}\left(
      [\mathbf{X}_{dynamic}, \mathbf{E}_{dyn}]\right)

3. Memory-augmented attention incorporates an external memory for
   referencing distant past patterns not directly present in the
   current window:
   .. math::
      \mathbf{H}_{mem} = \text{MemoryAugmentedAttention}(\mathbf{H}_{hier})

Next, static embeddings :math:`\mathbf{E}_{static}` (obtained from
processing static inputs) are combined with the outputs from LSTMs
and attention mechanisms:
.. math::
   \mathbf{H}_{combined} = \text{Concatenate}\left(
   [\mathbf{E}_{static}, \mathbf{H}_{lstm}, \mathbf{H}_{mem},
   \mathbf{H}_{cross}]\right)

The combined representation is decoded into multi-horizon forecasts:
.. math::
   \mathbf{Y}_{decoder} = \text{MultiDecoder}(\mathbf{H}_{combined})

For probabilistic forecasting, quantile distribution modeling

transforms the decoder outputs into quantile predictions:
.. math::
   \mathbf{Y}_{quantiles} = \text{QuantileDistributionModeling}\left(
   \mathbf{Y}_{decoder}\right)

The final predictions are thus:
.. math::
   \hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \mathbf{Y}_{quantiles}

The loss function incorporates both quantile loss for probabilistic
forecasting and anomaly loss for robust handling of irregularities:
.. math::
   \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{quantile} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{anomaly}

By adjusting :math:`\lambda`, the model can balance predictive
accuracy against robustness to anomalies.

Furthermore: 
    
- Multi-modal embeddings and multi-scale LSTMs enable the model to
  represent complex temporal patterns at various resolutions.
- Attention mechanisms (hierarchical, cross, memory-augmented)
  enrich the context and allow the model to focus on relevant
  aspects of the data.
- Quantile modeling provides probabilistic forecasts, supplying
  uncertainty intervals rather than single-point predictions.
- Techniques like residual connections, normalization, and
  anomaly loss weighting improve training stability and
  model robustness.

Methods
-------
call(inputs, training=False)
    Perform the forward pass through the model. Given a tuple
    ``(static_input, dynamic_input, future_covariate_input)``,
    it processes all features through embeddings, LSTMs, and
    attention mechanisms before producing final forecasts.
    
    - ``static_input``: 
      A tensor of shape :math:`(B, D_{static})` representing 
      the static features. These do not vary with time.
    - ``dynamic_input``: 
      A tensor of shape :math:`(B, T, D_{dynamic})` representing
      dynamic features across :math:`T` time steps. These include
      historical values and time-dependent covariates.
    - ``future_covariate_input``: 
      A tensor of shape :math:`(B, T, D_{future})` representing
      future-known features, aiding multi-horizon forecasting.

    Depending on the presence of quantiles:
    - If ``quantiles`` is not `None`: 
      The output shape is :math:`(B, H, Q, D_{out})`, where 
      :math:`H` is `forecast_horizons`, :math:`Q` is the number of
      quantiles, and :math:`D_{out}` is `output_dim`.
    - If ``quantiles`` is `None`: 
      The output shape is :math:`(B, H, D_{out})`, providing a 
      deterministic forecast for each horizon.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : tuple of tf.Tensor
        Input tensors `(static_input, dynamic_input, 
        future_covariate_input)`.
    training : bool, optional
        Whether the model is in training mode (default False).
        In training mode, layers like dropout and batch norm
        behave differently.

    Returns
    -------
    tf.Tensor
        The prediction tensor. Its shape and dimensionality depend
        on the `quantiles` setting. In probabilistic scenarios,
        multiple quantiles are returned. In deterministic mode, 
        a single prediction per horizon is provided.

compute_objective_loss(y_true, y_pred, anomaly_scores)
    Compute the total loss, combining both quantile loss (if 
    `quantiles` is not `None`) and anomaly loss. Quantile loss
    measures forecasting accuracy at specified quantiles, while
    anomaly loss penalizes unusual deviations or anomalies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : tf.Tensor
        Ground truth targets. Shape: :math:`(B, H, D_{out})`.
    y_pred : tf.Tensor
        Model predictions. If quantiles are present:
        :math:`(B, H, Q, D_{out})`. Otherwise:
        :math:`(B, H, D_{out})`.
    anomaly_scores : tf.Tensor
        Tensor indicating anomaly severity. Its shape typically
        matches `(B, H, D_{dynamic})` or a related dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    tf.Tensor
        A scalar tensor representing the combined loss. Lower 
        values indicate better performance, balancing accuracy
        and anomaly handling.

anomaly_loss(anomaly_scores)
    Compute the anomaly loss component. This term encourages the
    model to be robust against abnormal patterns in the data.
    Higher anomaly scores lead to higher loss, prompting the model
    to adjust predictions or representations to reduce anomalies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    anomaly_scores : tf.Tensor
        A tensor reflecting the presence and intensity of anomalies.
        Its shape often corresponds to time steps and dynamic 
        features, e.g., `(B, H, D_{dynamic})`.

    Returns
    -------
    tf.Tensor
        A scalar tensor representing the anomaly loss. Minimizing
        this term encourages the model to learn patterns that 
        mitigate anomalies and produce more stable forecasts.
